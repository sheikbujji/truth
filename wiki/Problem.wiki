#summary What are real and emerging problems?

= Introduction =

  * Hardware transient/permanent/intermittent fault
  * Software bug
  * Fail-safe system
  * High performance
  * Low power
  * Real-time
  * Low cost
  * Programmability
  * Extendability
  * Supporting new features (application of computers)

 What else...? maybe human health ...


 Wait a minute. Are those requirements well addressed? Why things are too complex? Isn't it true what we want is very simple? What we want for electronics?

 1. Easily express whatever we want them to do for us.

 2. We want to always get correct results (the system may operate continuously then all outputs by the system be correct). Bottom line is at least want to know when any incorrect result is generated.

    - here result can be any IO outputs and memory writes (e.g., due to memory-mapped IOs) 
    - what to check: whether the output or memory write is legal? address is correct? data is correct?
