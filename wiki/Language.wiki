#summary Programming Model

==== Method ====

  We do case studies to build a programming model where used examples are seizure detector and adaptive pacemaker.

==== Adaptive Pacemaker ====

  * Interface: input (user context - rest, walking, running - and user heartbeat rate) and output (controlled heartbeat rate)

  * Algorithm. 

  * Safety. Three constraints: (i) heartbeat rate is always within a range (60-120 times per minute), (ii) heartbeat rate does not rapidly change (attack and decay slopes are always within a bound), (iii) heartbeat rate never stay above a certain threshold for a longer than a certain time interval.

  * Reliability.


  * Security.


  * Real-time.

  * Other (low-power & performance). 

==== Seizure Detector ====
