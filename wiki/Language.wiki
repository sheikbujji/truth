#summary Programming Model

==== Method ====

  We do case studies to build a programming model where used examples are seizure detector and adaptive pacemaker.

==== Adaptive Pacemaker ====

  * Interface: input (user context - rest, walking, running - and user heartbeat rate) and output (controlled heartbeat rate)

  * Algorithm. 

  * Safety. Three constraints: (i) heartbeat rate is always within a range (60-120 times per minute), (ii) heartbeat rate does not rapidly change (attack and decay slopes are always within a bound), (iii) heartbeat rate never stay above a certain threshold for a longer than a certain time interval.

  * Reliability.


  * Security.


  * Real-time.

  * Other (low-power & performance). 

==== Seizure Detector ====

  * Interface: input (EEG signal(s) - analog data) and output (seizure alarm - binary signal)

  * Algorithm: There are multiple algorithms: threshold-based detection, neural network approach, and so on.

  * Safety. N/A (system should not harm the safety of patient).

  * Reliability.

  * Security. Free from software and hardware design bugs (automatic test case generation and testing)

  * Real-time. Online detection (quantitative spec TBD)
