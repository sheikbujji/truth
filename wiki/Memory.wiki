#summary new memory model
 
 Let consider a memory interface with an object identifier and the size of each variable (or object) belonging to a specific identifier can be dynamically changed.

 Interface is 

  * Read: Identifier -> Size of selected object, Data for selected object

  * Write: Identifier, Size of Object, and Data of Object -> Done (if synchronous device)


 Assume that variable-granularity accesses are handled by on-chip cache (i.e., SRAM). This object memory is only used to fetch job description and store computation results. 

 ====What is it good for====

  * 


  * Almost infinite memory illusion. This could be an orthogonal issue. It can supports identifier count larger than the physical memory size. It's not infinite address space but still the total accessible memory space is limited by max identifier count x max object size.

  * What is it not good for


 ====How to build this memory?====

  * Log structured memory system for fault-tolerance (replay is feasible). It can use a nonvolatile memory device.
