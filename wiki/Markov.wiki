#summary Markov Analysis

= Introduction =

  We use Markov analysis for high-level system architecture design. Markov analysis is important as it was shown in TMR analysis, i.e., TMR (triple modular redundancy) does not always provide higher reliability than original system with single execution instance.


  Markov analysis is valid within its analyzed model. TMR for example is a fail-stop system, while the original one is not where fail-stop is critical in safe-critical systems. Fail-stop (or preemptive error detection) becomes more valuable when it comes with an error isolation technique because these can realize fine-grained error recovery.
