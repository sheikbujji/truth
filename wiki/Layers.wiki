#summary Layers in Computer System

= Introduction =

  At the end, eveything is mapped into the movement of electronics (or bits). All computer system layers (from RTL to application) are abstractions (or virtualization) for those electron movements. It is similar to the fact that all materials and human/animal bodies are compositions of atoms. Human call those sets of atoms to cells, organs, and so on.

  Question 1. Fault-tolerance technique shall be implemented in one layer or multiple?

  Multiple layers. Admitting the fact that there is no physical system that is 100% reliable (might be one with 99.999999999999% reliable), higher layer shall monitor the correctness of operations executed by its lower layer components. What does a higher layer means at here (everything is movement of electrons)? 

  Question 2. What are tradeoffs for implementing fault-tolerance techniques in lower layer and higher layer?
