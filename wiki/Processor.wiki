#summary Building a simple pipelined 32-bit processor

= Introduction =

 Processor consists of control and datapath parts.

  * Control: Generate control signals for every decoded instruction
  * Datapath: Actual computations are done by using ALUs, registers, and so on. It is controlled by control signals. It can be pipelined (i.e., with latches between each pipeline stage).
