#summary Setup for development environment

 This document describes the procedure of setting up a development environment for the Truth Framework. Here, we use two PC machines: one is an x86 machine running Linux OS, and the other is an x86 machine running Windows and Cygwin. In addition, an FPGA board (Altera ep2s60-ddr) is used as a target development board (Note that this Altera board is selected thanks to its fast synthesis time, ~20min).

1. Processor 

- Downloads Leon3 from the Gaisler website (used version: grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4102)
- Configures Leon3:

  $ cd designs/leon3-altera-ep2s60-ddr
  $ make config

- Opens created Quartus project (filename: leon3mp.qpf)
  then synthesizes, implements, and generates program file
  to generate an FPGA program image file 

- Behavioral simulation setup using the file under designs/leon3-digilient-xup instead of one for altera for simulation

  $ make vsim (to generate testbench.mpf)
  $ make soft (to build ROM and RAM images)
  $ make ahbrom (to generate the AHBROM.vhd file)

2. Cross-Compiler

2.1. LLVM



2.2. BCC

- There is a prebuilt compiler for SPARC/Leon3 that can be downloaded from the Gaisler website.

In file "~/snapgear-2.6-p36c/vendors/gaisler/leon3mmu/Makefile" line:

CROSS_COMPILER_ROOT = $(shell which $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc |sed -e
's/bin\/sparc-linux-gcc//')

must be replaced for:

CROSS_COMPILER_ROOT = /opt/sparc-linux-3.4.4/
